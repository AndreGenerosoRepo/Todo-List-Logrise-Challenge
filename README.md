## My process

For this challenge my initial priority was to to create an identical html layout and ajust it with my custom css properties.
Before jumping into TypeScript i started to refactor the project structure and the code , by building new Folders and separating into smaller components.
Since it was a typescript project,i was able to create and work with interfaces which allowed me to define the shape of the objects.This helps ensure that objects conform to a specific structure throughout your codebase. , plus it gives a good code readability and reusability.
For the functionality, i started to do the AddTodo Task, followed by removeTask & Edit Task ,filters.
The Light mode and Dark mode toggles are functioning but it could be done better.
To be responsive in different device screen size i used flexbox layout.
By avoiding external libraries it made the project even more challenging and made me consolidate more of my skills and learned more about typescript.
